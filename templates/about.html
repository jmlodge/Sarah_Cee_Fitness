				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Hi there, thanks for popping by! My name is Sarah and Iâ€™m a Personal Trainer and Fitness Instructor based in York.</p>

<p>A little bit about me:
I went into the fitness industry because I truly understand the importance of a healthy body and mind for a fantastic life and I have always had a genuine desire to help people.</p> 

<p>Having been on my own journey and getting tired of feeling bad about myself, I began running as a way to get exercise and start feeling good. My mother was adamant it had changed her life, so I gave it a go and I knew that she was right (as always!). I instantly felt better in my body and my mind and it became addictive. I quickly realised that running was not the only way to feel amazing, so I began to explore other paths to lead a happy, healthy and fulfilling life. I felt so inspired about how exercise, real nutrition and a positive mindset had such a profoundly positive affect, that I knew it was my mission to share the message and inspire others to feel amazing too.</p> 

<p>So whether your goal is to lose weight, get stronger or simply to feel fantastic - I'm the girl for you!</p>
