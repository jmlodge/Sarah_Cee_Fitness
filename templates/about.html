				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Hi there, thanks for popping by! My name is Sarah and Iâ€™m a Personal Trainer and Fitness Instructor based in York.

A little bit about me:
I went into the fitness industry because I truly understand the importance of a healthy body and mind for a fantastic life and I have always had a genuine desire to help people. 

Having been on my own journey and getting tired of feeling bad about myself, I began running as a way to get exercise and start feeling good. My mother was adamant it had changed her life, so I gave it a go and I knew that she was right (as always!). I instantly felt better in my body and my mind and it became addictive. I quickly realised that running was not the only way to feel amazing, so I began to explore other paths to lead a happy, healthy and fulfilling life. I felt so inspired about how exercise, real nutrition and a positive mindset had such a profoundly positive affect, that I knew it was my mission to share the message and inspire others to feel amazing too. 

So whether your goal is to lose weight, get stronger or simply to feel fantastic - I'm the girl for you!
